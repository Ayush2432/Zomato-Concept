TEch Stack:
          ->Mongodb as the database
          ->AWS S3 as a block storage for storing the images
          -> Open street map(open source could be used for map integration)

Deployment-:
           ->Dockerizing is an important part as it keeps data in small-small part 
                         so it is easy for the admins to understand it

GitHub Repo->CICD(it tell that small packets /or we can say co have been created)->AWS for the deployment
